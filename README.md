Task :A file full of Twitter tweets by various users and you are provided 
a set of words that indicates racial slurs. Write a program that can 
indicate the degree of profanity for each sentence in the file.

The Assumptions I am taking:
1. There is one tweet per line in the plain text format file.
2. A list of racist slurs will be used as a profanity indicator.
3. We will count the number of profanity indications in a tweet to 
determine how profane it is.
